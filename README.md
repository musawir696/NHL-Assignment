# NHL Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my debugging and machine learning exercises, primarily focusing on:

1. **Python debugging exercises** for arrays, sets, and CSV handling.  
2. **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) exercises** using PyTorch:
   - Generator and Discriminator networks
   - GAN training loop with MNIST
   - Image plotting during training
3. **Notebook** for debugging (`debugging.ipynb`)

> **Note:** This repository currently contains only `debugging.ipynb`. Other files were removed to reduce repository size.
